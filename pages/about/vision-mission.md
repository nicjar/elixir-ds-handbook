# Vision

Research Data Management (RDM) professionals provide RDM support services for researchers of life/natural science that enable researchers to implement and maintain RDM best practices.

# Mission
The mission of the Data Steward Handbook is to help RDM professionals excel in their roles by providing practical guidance, real-world examples and best practices, pointing to existing resources, to improve local RDM services and tasks – it addresses community building, career development and RDM service maturity. The Handbook consolidates and disseminates knowledge of data stewards in an open and accessible way expanding the exchange of best practices beyond the borders of local institutions and communities.
